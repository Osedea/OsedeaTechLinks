### More info about this Repo
Link example: [Osedea homepage](https://osedea.com/en) | Author or Estimated Read time (Optional) \
Multiple nested sub directories can be created for each topic/language/framework.

Many of the links accumulated here, were shared by our team on our internal slack or are recommended readings for our new devs in training. These are the links that have proved to be very informative and worth archiving and coming back to.

We also felt much of this information should be shared and further explored, so we are making this archive open source in the hopes of increasing collaboration and accumulating more links and topics of information.

The content of each link represents the views of their respective authors and does directly respresent the views or culture of the Osedea Team.
